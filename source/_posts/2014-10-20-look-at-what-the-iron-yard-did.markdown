On July 21, 2014, I took a departure from the normal course of my life to engage in an arduous but fulfilling computer science bootcamp. <!--more--> [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) is a collection of fast-paced information-dense 21st century computer science learning centers that seek to produce fully capable developers in just a few months. Luckily, my hometown of Beaufort, SC, is not too far from the Mt. Pleasant, SC Iron Yard location. I changed the oil in my car and prepared to drive halfway around the world in an effort to expand my understanding of the way the web is built today.
